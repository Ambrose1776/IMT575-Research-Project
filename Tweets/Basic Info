Twitter IDs are downloaded from: https://github.com/echen102/COVID-19-TweetIDs
Use twarc library to 'hydrate' IDs, resuling in a JSON file. 
More info on twarc can be found here: https://github.com/DocNow/twarc
A Twitter Developer Account is needed to use twarc. I found it necessary to create an application.
I used my twitter account URL for the required fields when creating the app.
