## Welcome to Fake News Police Project Page

In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the glaboal spread of a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 a pandemic. COVID‚Äê19 pandemic has affected over 100 countries in a matter of weeks. People's response toward social distancing in the emerging pandemic is uncertain. In this project, we hope to undetstand what the overall social attitudes toward social distancing policy are like in the state of Washington and Florida, and to explore what degree these attitudes are reflected in measures of social distancing practices. 

Our analysis appraoch is to first perform a sentiment analysis of tweets that mention topics related to COVID-19 and social distancing, and we will only focus on tweets from Washington and Florida. Also, we will measure the general sentiment towards social distancing policy in these two states over different time periods. Then, we will use Google aggregated mobility data to understand the population movement pattern in these two states and study to what degree these changes in movement patterns reflect the public sentiment on social distancing.

### Background
Sentiment analysis of data from Twitter is nothing new. The United Nations has been using data from Twitter and other social media platforms to understand public perception of specific health initiatives in certain countries. To date there has been some work done on sentiment analysis of Twitter data with respect to COVID-19. Researchers have explored attitudes on using masks (Shen, 2020), categorizing tweets by emotion and building word frequency charts (Lim, 2020), and understanding topics of conversation and overall sentiment and emotional intensity across the Twitterverse (2020).
