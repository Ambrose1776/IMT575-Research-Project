## Welcome to Fake News Police Project Page

In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the glaboal spread of a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 a pandemic. COVID‐19 pandemic has affected over 100 countries in a matter of weeks. People's response toward social distancing in the emerging pandemic is uncertain. In this project, we hope to undetstand what the overall social attitudes toward social distancing policy are like in the state of Washington and Florida, and to explore what degree these attitudes are reflected in measures of social distancing practices. 

Our analysis appraoch is to first perform a sentiment analysis of tweets that mention topics related to COVID-19 and social distancing, and we will only focus on tweets from Washington and Florida. Also, we will measure the general sentiment towards social distancing policy in these two states over different time periods. Then, we will use Google aggregated mobility data to understand the population movement pattern in these two states and study to what degree these changes in movement patterns reflect the public sentiment on social distancing.

### Background
Sentiment analysis of data from Twitter is nothing new. The United Nations has been using data from Twitter and other social media platforms to understand public perception of specific health initiatives in certain countries. To date there has been some work done on sentiment analysis of Twitter data with respect to COVID-19. Researchers have explored attitudes on using masks (Shen, 2020), categorizing tweets by emotion and building word frequency charts (Lim, 2020), and understanding topics of conversation and overall sentiment and emotional intensity across the Twitterverse (2020).

During March of 2020, the World Health Organization declared the global spread of a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 a pandemic. The spread of the virus elicited much debate about the veracity of the media’s coverage of the disease and its effects. In some cases government officials even publicly denounced its existence, claiming it was a “hoax” or “no worse than the flu”. However, at present time epidemiological studies estimate a mortality rate between 0.66%(Verity, et al., 2020) and 1.5% (Wu, et al., 2020), significantly higher than that found in seasonal flu. Given the divergence in perception of SARS-CoV-2, it is vital to understand to what extent mitigation efforts during health crises are influenced by misinformation and institutional trust. 

Limiting our scope to the country with the largest number of recorded infections, the United States, we hypothesize that there are regional or community-based differences in how the population perceives mitigation strategies related to COVID-19, that these perceptions and sentiments will be shared on Twitter, that we can model how different regions or communities feel with respect to mitigation strategies, and that these feelings will be reflected in measures of social distancing practices. This work seeks to answer the following question:

To what degree do mitigation practices reflect social attitudes toward policies aimed at slowing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 such as social distancing and quarantines?
